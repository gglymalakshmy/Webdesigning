       <p>Department Of Ship Technology is one of the pioneers in the field of Naval Architecture education in this country and was established in 1975 with an aim to create a new and dynamic generation of Naval Architects to meet the requirements of the Indian Shipbuilding Industry, Ship Classification Societies, R&D organizations, Indian Navy, and related organisations. This Department maintains active collaboration and interaction with IITs, foreign Universities, shipyards and other industries. These organizations have been generous in extending their facilities and expertise to impart training to our students. The fruitful collaboration of this Department with Rostock University, Germany dates back to 1978 and remains as an important milestone in the development of this Department. The curriculum was drawn up and updated in consultation with experts from various academic institutions and industries. This has brought the course curriculum in conformity with international standards. The quality of education imparted and the resulting professional competence of the graduates enabled the Department to achieve a unique record of 100 percent placement of its graduates in India and abroad.
